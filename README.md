# Ultimate Super Mega Golf
##### The golf name we don't need, but the one we deserve

Ultimate Super Mega Golf is a small minigolf-style game I'm making in C++ using the [raylib]() and [EnTT]() libraries, and (hopefully!) nothing else. Of course, I am aware that this is not the _best_ way there is to develop a game, but I'm mostly just doing this to dip my toes into low-level game development and because I like the multi-paradigm mess that is C++.

As for builds, I don't have anything yet because the code is far from being finished... (There _is_ an executable in `bin/` but it literally just has a test of an array class).
